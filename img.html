    <h2>Hello, Boss!</h2>
    <p>This is your div content. The cause of the disease is unknown.[11] ME/CFS often starts after an infection, such as mononucleosis.[12] It can run in families, but no genes that contribute to ME/CFS have been confirmed.[13] ME/CFS is associated with changes in the nervous and immune systems, as well as in energy production.[14] Diagnosis is based on symptoms and a differential diagnosis because no diagnostic test is available (diagnosis by exclusion).[7][15]

The illness can improve or worsen over time, but full recovery is uncommon.[12] No therapies or medications are approved to treat the condition, and management is aimed at relieving symptoms.[2]: 29  Pacing of activities can help avoid worsening symptoms, and counselling may help in coping with the illness.[8] Before the COVID-19 pandemic, ME/CFS affected two to nine out of every 1000 people, depending on the definition.[9] However, many people fit ME/CFS diagnostic criteria after contracting long COVID.[16] ME/CFS occurs more often in women than in men. It most commonly affects adults between ages 40 and 60 but can occur at other ages, including childhood.[17]

ME/CFS has a large social and economic impact, and the disease can be socially isolating.[18] About a quarter of those affected are unable to leave their bed or home.[10]: 3  People with ME/CFS often face stigma in healthcare settings, and care is complicated by controversies around the cause and treatments of the illness.[19] Doctors may be unfamiliar with ME/CFS, as it is often not fully covered in medical school.[16] Historically, research funding for ME/CFS has been far below that of diseases with comparable impact.[20]The cause of the disease is unknown.[11] ME/CFS often starts after an infection, such as mononucleosis.[12] It can run in families, but no genes that contribute to ME/CFS have been confirmed.[13] ME/CFS is associated with changes in the nervous and immune systems, as well as in energy production.[14] Diagnosis is based on symptoms and a differential diagnosis because no diagnostic test is available (diagnosis by exclusion).[7][15]
